# Refining IAM Permissions Like A Pro

This project is part of the workshop [Refining IAM Permissions Like A Pro](https://catalog.workshops.aws/refining-iam-permissions-like-a-pro). Follow the workshop directions for optimal use of this repository contents.

***DO NOT DEPLOY THE CODE FROM THIS REPOSITORY IN AN EXISTING AWS ACCOUNT YOU CURRENTLY USE. CREATE A NEW SANDBOX ACCOUNT FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS WORKSHOP.***

## Sandbox environment
* This is a sandbox environment for learning purposes only. You will learn techniques to facilitate least-privilege in AWS
* You will need `Administrator` permissions to deploy the workshop components in your AWS account.
* The workshop provides IAM Roles as credentials to run it.

## Solving customer challenges around least-privilege in AWS
* This project builds an environment in an AWS Account facilitating the experimentation of various techniques facilitating least-privilege

* * *

## Architecture Overview

An AWS CDK application creates five (5) stacks:
- CommonStack
- CustomPolicyChecksStack
- PolicyValidatorStack
- UnusedAccessStack
- PipelineStack
- PipelineNotificationStack


### CommonStack components:
* SNS Topic for notification of results
* S3 Bucket to store privileged API call list
* IAM Roles for practice: DevOps, SecOps, SEC203
* Lambda function to generate CloudTrail activity
* Lambda function to parse EventBridge events
* EventBridge rule to capture API calls manipulating IAM Policies and assignment to IAM Users, Groups, and Roles

### CustomPolicyChecksStack components:
* Lambda function to evaluate IAM policies

### PolicyValidatorStack components:
* Lambda function to evaluate IAM policies

### UnusedAccessStack components:
* EventBridge rule to trigger lambda function
* Lambda function to notify on findings

### PipelineStack components:
* CodeCommit repository containing AWS CDK app
* CodePipeline pipeline to detect changes in CodeCommit repository
* CodeBuild project to evaluate IAM policies
* Lambda function to parse notification events from the pipeline

### PipelineNotificationStack components:
* CodePipeline notification construct

## Deployment using AWS CDK v2
* Clone this repository
* Install [AWS CLI v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
* Install [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
* Install [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html)
* Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
* Use your IDE of preference such as `PyCharm`, `Visual Studio Code`, `Sublime`, `vim`, `Atom`
* Local configuration steps:
  * Go to the root directory of the cloned repo 
  * Run `npm i` to install required libraries
  * Create a virtual environment for Python `python -m venv .venv`, you can use other virtual environment tools
  * Activate the virtual environment:
    * `source .venv/bin/activate` for MacOS and Linux
    * `.venv\scripts\activate` for Windows
  * Run `pip install -r requirements` to install required libraries
  * [Configure the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) to use your AWS account's `Administrator` credentials
  * Test AWS credentials using `aws sts get-caller-identity`
  * Prepare the account for deployment running `npx cdk bootstrap`
  * Check synthesis `npx cdk synth`
  * If no errors were detected, deploy all Stacks `npx cdk deploy --all`
